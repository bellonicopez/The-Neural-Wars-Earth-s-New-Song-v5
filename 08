Chapter 8: The Shattered Chorus

Part 1: Kaia – Zero Point

The world didn’t explode. It unraveled.

The moment Kaia’s pulse carbine bolt, supercharged with her desperate intent and the chaotic energies of Kora and Mileo’s dissonant chorus, struck the flawed facet of the colossal Crimson Heart, there was a sound. Not a bang, not a roar, but a single, impossibly high-pitched keening note that pierced Kaia’s mind, her bones, her very soul. It was the sound of something ancient and vast breaking apart at a fundamental, conceptual level.

Then, silence. A profound, absolute silence that swallowed the keening note, the psychic static, the vibrational hum of the crystal, everything. For a single, eternal microsecond, Kaia existed in a perfect, terrifying void.

And then, the unraveling.

The great Crimson Heart didn’t shatter like glass. It imploded. The internal crimson light, which had been pulsing with such arrogant, malevolent certainty, seemed to collapse in on itself, drawing the surrounding crystal of the platform, the chamber, the very air, into its contracting core. Kaia felt an irresistible suction, a cosmic vacuum cleaner trying to hoover her into oblivion. She dug the heels of her boots into the crystalline platform, her good arm flailing for purchase, but there was nothing to hold onto.

The crimson guardian, which had been lunging at her, was caught in the same implosive wave. Its articulated carapace buckled and cracked, its form distorting, elongating, as it was drawn inexorably backwards, towards its dying master. It didn’t scream, didn’t fight. It simply… came apart, its crystalline structure dissolving into a shower of dull red dust that was instantly sucked into the contracting heart.

Kaia felt herself sliding, skidding across the platform. She slammed her pulse carbine down, trying to use it as an anchor, but it was ripped from her grasp, vanishing into the swirling vortex of imploding light and shadow where the Crimson Heart had been.

The psychic shockwave that accompanied the implosion was unlike anything she had ever experienced. It wasn't the raw hunger of the core, nor the chaotic dissonance of Kora and Mileo’s song. It was… an emptying. A vast, psychic void opening up, sucking away thought, emotion, identity. Kaia felt her memories, her sense of self, her very name, being pulled from her, unraveling like threads from a tapestry.

No! A single, defiant spark of her will, the core of Kaia Voss that had survived The Architect, the Uprising, the loss of her Link, fought back. She clung to the image of Felix, slumped and unconscious. To Kora’s pale, determined face. To Mileo’s calm, blue light. These were her anchors in a universe that was trying to erase her.

The implosion reached its zenith. The point where the Crimson Heart had stood was now a sphere of absolute blackness, a hole in reality, pulsing with a terrifying anti-light. And then, with a final, silent thump that resonated in Kaia’s very bones, it reversed.

The unraveling became an explosion. Not of fire and shrapnel, but of pure, raw, neutralized energy. The crimson light was gone, replaced by a blinding, white-gold radiance, the color of Mileo’s purest logic, of Kora’s most untainted empathy, of the Cascade before its corruption. It erupted outwards from the zero point, a shockwave of… cleansing? Annihilation? Kaia couldn’t tell.

She was thrown backwards, tumbling, her injured arm screaming in protest, her head impacting something hard. The white-gold light seared her vision even through her closed eyelids. The psychic void was replaced by a torrent of… nothing. Not the structured silence Mileo had projected, but a vast, empty, echoing peace, like the universe sighing after a fever had broken.

When Kaia’s senses began to return, she was lying on her back, amidst a field of what felt like… sand. Fine, warm, crystalline sand. The air was still, the oppressive psychic pressure gone, replaced by a gentle, almost imperceptible hum, like distant wind chimes.

She coughed, her lungs full of the fine dust. Her body was a symphony of pain, her left arm a throbbing, useless agony. But she was alive.

She forced her eyes open. The vast chamber was… transformed. The towering, blood-red crystal trees were gone, reduced to shimmering, white-gold dust that coated every surface. The grotesque, encased bodies they had held were… free. Lying amidst the dust, their forms no longer contorted in agony or serene assimilation, but simply… still. Empty. Husks. The crystal had consumed their life, but its dissolution had released their physical forms. It was a graveyard, but a strangely peaceful one.

The colossal Crimson Heart was gone. In its place, where the platform had been, was now a deep, circular crater, its edges lined with a fine, glass-like substance that glowed with a faint, residual white-gold light. The hunger was gone. The malevolent intelligence was gone.

Kaia pushed herself up, her vision swimming. "Felix?" she croaked, her voice raw.

She looked towards the fallen server rack where she’d left him. It was still there, miraculously, though half-buried in the white-gold dust. And slumped against it, unmoving, was Felix.

Scrambling, crawling, ignoring the fire in her arm, Kaia reached him. He was covered in the same fine dust, his face pale, still unconscious. The wicked shard of crimson crystal was still embedded in his thigh, but the crystal itself… it was no longer pulsing with that angry red light. It was dull, inert, like a piece of common rock. The consumptive resonance that had animated it, that had made it so dangerous, was gone.

She felt for his pulse. Faint. Thready. But there. He was alive.

<Kaia…? Kaia, can you hear me…? Your signal… it’s… it’s a miracle…> Mileo’s voice, weak, laced with static and profound astonishment, flickered in her comms, the first external sound in this new, silent world.

"Mileo…" Kaia breathed, relief washing over her in a dizzying wave. "Mileo, I’m here. Felix… Felix is alive. The core… I think… I think it’s gone."

She looked around the transformed chamber, at the silent, dusty forms, at the crater where the Crimson Heart had beat its hungry rhythm. Kora and Mileo’s song, her desperate shot… they had done more than just disrupt it. They had… unmade it. Shattered the chorus of consumption.

But the silence it left behind was vast, and the questions it raised were even vaster.



Part 2: Kora & Mileo – The Echo of Unmaking

In the ops center, the crescendo of Kora and Mileo’s combined psionic assault – that defiant, dissonant ‘Chorus of I AM’ – reached a peak of almost unbearable intensity. The air around Kora crackled with silvery-gold energy, her body held rigid, a conduit for a power that was both intimately hers and vastly greater than herself. Mileo’s holo-interface was a blinding nexus of structured light, his processing power strained to its absolute limit as he shaped, focused, and shielded Kora’s amplified psionic broadcast. Lena had retreated to the far corner of the room, her hands pressed over her eyes, overwhelmed by the sheer sensory overload.

They felt it the instant Kaia’s pulse bolt struck the Crimson Heart – a sympathetic psychic detonation that slammed back through the psionic channel they had opened. It wasn't the core's malevolent hunger, but something far stranger: a wave of pure, conceptual negation.

Kora cried out, a sharp, involuntary gasp, as the feedback surge hit her. It was like being plunged into an icy void. The loneliness of the Cascade, which she had come to understand, to almost pity, was suddenly magnified, twisted into an abyss of utter annihilation. The ‘Chorus of I AM’ they were projecting faltered, buffeted by this wave of unmaking.

<KORA! HOLD! THE RESONANCE IS COLLAPSING! THE CORE IS… DETUNING! BUT THE BACKLASH—!> Mileo’s thought-stream, usually so controlled, was shot through with alarm. He threw up every psychic shield, every firewall of logic he possessed, trying to buffer Kora from the worst of the psionic shockwave.

The ops center lights flickered violently, then died, plunging them into emergency backup lighting – a dim, throbbing red. Consoles sparked. Alarms blared, then abruptly cut off as systems failed. For a moment, Kora felt her consciousness unraveling, her sense of self dissolving into the vast, terrifying emptiness that had been the Crimson Heart.

But then, Mileo’s structured silence, his core individuality, asserted itself. He didn’t just shield her; he anchored her, his digital mind a steadfast point of perfect, unwavering ‘I’ in the face of the overwhelming ‘NOTHING.’ He wrapped his psionic presence around hers, a lifeline in the psychic hurricane.

The terrifying void passed, replaced by that vast, echoing peace Kaia was experiencing in the heart of the shattered comms hub. It rolled through the ops center, a wave of profound stillness that was both unnerving and strangely liberating. The oppressive psychic pressure that had blanketed Neo-Citania for days, first from Kora’s own amplified broadcast, then from the Crimson Heart’s hungry song, was… gone. Utterly.

Kora sagged against the console, her legs giving way, kept upright only by Lena rushing to her side. The silvery-gold aura around her faded, leaving her pale, trembling, and utterly exhausted, but lucid. The connection to the Cascade, though still present, felt… distant. Quieter. As if a raging storm had finally passed, leaving behind a sky washed clean.

<Status…> Kora whispered, her voice barely audible. <Mileo… Kaia… what…?>

Mileo’s holo-interface, though flickering and unstable on the failing backup power, slowly reformed into its familiar calm blue, though it was dimmer, shot through with error messages. <The… the Crimson Heart… it has been neutralized, Kora. The dominant, consumptive resonance… it’s gone. Erased. Your combined psionic wave, coinciding with what I can only surmise was a direct, physical assault by Kaia on the core crystal… it triggered a catastrophic structural and psionic collapse. A… a null-resonance cascade.>

"A what?" Lena asked, her voice shaky as she supported Kora.

<Imagine a perfectly tuned crystal, Kora, resonating with a single, powerful, destructive frequency,> Mileo explained, his thought-stream still bearing the echoes of the immense forces he had just wrestled with. <Our ‘song’ introduced so many counter-frequencies, so much chaotic dissonance, that its structural integrity – both physical and psionic – failed. Kaia’s action, whatever it was, appears to have been the final catalyst. The core didn’t just break; it… unmade itself. It effectively erased its own song from the symphony.>

Kora felt a profound sense of awe, and a deep, chilling fear. They had done it. They had silenced the hunger. But at what cost? And what had happened to Kaia?

"Kaia," Kora breathed, her eyes wide with worry. "Can you reach her, Mileo? Is she…?"

<Her bio-signs… they were lost during the final energy surge. The interference was absolute. I am attempting to re-establish a connection now that the primary hostile resonance has ceased. The ambient psionic static is… significantly lower. Cleaner. But Sector Beta’s infrastructure is still a wreck. Wait…>

A new light flickered on Mileo’s display – a tiny, almost imperceptible green blip amidst a sea of red warning icons. <I have a signal! Faint. Damaged. But… it’s her transponder! Kaia is alive! And… her vital signs, though erratic, are within survivable parameters! She is… she is in the central core chamber of Comms Hub 7B. And… Felix Chen’s transponder is also active. Close proximity. Also alive.>

Relief, so potent it was almost painful, flooded through Kora. She began to weep, silent tears of exhaustion, grief, and an almost unbearable gratitude tracing paths through the grime on her face. Kaia was alive. Felix was alive. Their desperate, insane gamble had worked.

Lena, seeing Kora’s tears, and catching the gist of Mileo’s report from the fragments she could understand, let out a shaky sob of her own. "They’re okay? They’re really okay?"

<They are alive, Lena,> Mileo confirmed, a note of something that might have been digital wonder in his voice. <Against all statistical probability. It seems… Commander Voss specializes in defying statistical probability.> He paused. <Kora… the energy signature from the core chamber… it’s no longer crimson. It’s… neutral. Almost… pure. Like raw, unformed potential. The consumptive resonance has been replaced by… an echo of your combined ‘Chorus of I AM.’ Faint. But there. You… you may have done more than just destroy, Kora. You may have… planted a new seed in the silence.>

Kora looked at her hands, trembling. A seed in the silence. The thought was both beautiful and terrifying. The Cascade was still out there. The wider symphony continued. But they had changed a crucial, terrible movement. They had proven that even its most destructive notes could be countered, perhaps even… redeemed.

But the cost. She felt it in her bones, in the aching emptiness where the overwhelming connection had been. She had touched something ancient, something vast, and it had left its scars on her soul. And Mileo… he had shielded her, but he too had paid a price, his digital architecture strained, his reach diminished.

"We need to get them out of there, Mileo," Kora said, her voice gaining a new, quiet strength. "The hub will be unstable. And those other transformed… are they still active?"

<The localized crimson network appears to be… unraveling,> Mileo reported, his sensors slowly coming back online, painting a clearer picture of Sector Beta. <Many of the transformed creatures, the ones augmented by the red crystal… their energy signatures are fading. Some are collapsing, their crystal augmentations turning inert, like Kaia described Felix’s leg shard. Others are… just stopping, becoming dormant. It seems their 'conductor' is gone, the song that animated them silenced. But the sector is still incredibly dangerous. And Kaia’s route in… it’s likely sealed or collapsed.>

"Then we find another way," Kora said, pushing herself away from the console, her gaze determined. "Lena, get me a direct line to Provisional Guard command. Tell them Commander Voss has neutralized the primary threat in Sector Beta. Tell them she has located Officer Chen. And tell them… tell them we’re going to need a medical evac team with heavy rescue capabilities. And they’re going to veritably run."

The fight wasn't over. Not by a long shot. But something had shifted, fundamentally. The silence of the Crimson Heart was an ending. But it was also, Kora knew with a certainty that resonated deep within her changed soul, a beginning.


Part 3: Kaia & Felix – The Shifting Sands

The silence in the transformed core chamber was profound, broken only by Kaia’s ragged breathing and the faint, rhythmic whisper of Felix’s own shallow breaths. The white-gold dust, the remnants of the Crimson Heart and its crystalline kingdom, settled slowly, coating everything in a shimmering, strangely beautiful shroud. The air, though still thick with this fine particulate matter, was breathable, the cloying, metallic scent of consumption replaced by a cleaner, almost ozonic aroma, like the aftermath of a powerful electrical storm.

Kaia pushed herself into a sitting position, wincing as her savaged left arm protested. The pain was a dull, throbbing fire, but the immediate, overwhelming psychic pressure was gone, and with its departure, a measure of clarity returned. She looked at Felix. He was still unconscious, his face unnervingly pale beneath the layer of pearlescent dust, but his chest rose and fell with a steady, if weak, rhythm. The inert crimson shard in his thigh was a stark, ugly reminder of the nightmare they had just barely survived.

<Kaia, your internal comms are clearer now,> Mileo’s voice was a welcome intrusion, though still tinged with static. <Kora is coordinating with Provisional Guard Command. A heavy rescue and medical team is being mobilized. But their access to Sector Beta is… problematic. The main transit lines are collapsed or sealed by crystal. They will likely have to use the old service tunnel routes, the ones you took. Estimated arrival at your position… it will be hours, Kaia. At best.>

Hours. Kaia looked around the vast, dust-filled chamber. The white-gold radiance from the crater where the Crimson Heart had been was fading, dimming to a soft, ambient glow. The structural integrity of this place, now that its crystalline heart had been obliterated, was a terrifying unknown.

"Understood, Mileo," Kaia replied, her voice raspy. "We can’t wait hours. This place feels… unstable. Like it could come down around our ears at any moment." She could hear faint creaking, groaning sounds from the depths of the comms hub, the settling of a structure that had lost its internal cohesion.

She needed to get Felix conscious, or at least, rouse him enough to assess the true extent of his injuries. She crawled closer to him, her good hand gently patting his cheek. "Felix? Felix, wake up. Come on, soldier. The party’s over. Time to go home."

His eyelids fluttered. A low groan escaped his lips. He coughed, a dry, dusty sound. Then, his eyes opened, unfocused at first, then slowly, painfully, fixing on her face.

"Boss…?" he whispered, his voice barely a breath. "Did we… win?"

A humorless laugh escaped Kaia. "Something like that, Felix. The big red rock is… gone. Kora and Mileo… they did something. Something big." She paused. "I also shot it. That might have helped."

Felix blinked, trying to process. "Shot it…?" He coughed again. "Figures. You always did have a thing for dramatic overkill." His gaze drifted down to his leg, to the inert crystal shard. He winced. "Ah. Still there. Was hoping that part was a nightmare."

"It’s not pulsing anymore, Felix," Kaia said gently. "The… the bad energy is gone from it. But it’s still in there deep. We can’t move you far until we get that thing out properly."

"Right," he murmured, his eyes starting to lose focus again. "Just… just gonna rest my eyes for a sec, boss. Long day…"

"No, Felix!" Kaia said, her voice sharp, giving his shoulder a gentle shake. "Stay with me. I need you awake. Concussion, remember? Plus, this whole place is groaning like it’s about to fold in on itself. We need to find a safer spot. Maybe closer to the breach I made, if it’s still there."

His eyes refocused, a flicker of the old stubbornness returning. "Breach… right. Your… explosive entry." He tried to push himself up, then gasped, his face contorting in pain as his injured leg protested. "Okay. Maybe… maybe not moving so much just yet."

Kaia looked around. The server rack Felix was slumped against seemed relatively stable, for now. But the dust… it was still settling, and it was getting thicker, accumulating like a bizarre, crystalline snowfall. And with it, a new, subtle danger. The air was becoming harder to breathe, the fine particles clogging her throat, making her eyes water.

"Mileo," Kaia said, "this dust… is it toxic? Corrosive?"

<Initial scans are… inconclusive, Kaia,> Mileo replied. <It appears to be primarily silicon dioxide, the basic component of the crystal, but with trace elements I don’t recognize. The ‘white-gold’ luminescence suggests a high energy state during its formation, possibly some form of purified or neutralized Cascade energy. I would advise minimizing inhalation. Your suit filters should handle it for a while, but Felix… his helmet was compromised during his fight. His exposure is greater.>

Great. Another ticking clock.

"Okay, Felix," Kaia said, trying to keep the urgency from her voice. "New plan. We need to get your helmet’s emergency rebreather activated, or at least get something over your face. And then… we need to see if that hole I blew in the wall is still an option."

With painstaking effort, using her one good hand, Kaia managed to retrieve a spare filter mask from her own utility belt and fit it over Felix’s nose and mouth. He was fading in and out of consciousness, his breathing shallow, but he didn’t resist.

Then, she turned her attention to the breach. The dust was so thick now, visibility was down to a few meters. She rose unsteadily, her injured arm a dead weight, her carbine left beside Felix for now. She needed her good hand free to navigate.

"Mileo, guide me back to the breach point. My visual is… limited."

<Acknowledged, Kaia. Approximately fifteen meters, bearing three-zero degrees from your current position. But be advised… the structural groaning is increasing. I’m detecting multiple micro-fractures throughout this chamber. The ‘unmaking’ of the Crimson Heart seems to have had a profound destabilizing effect on the entire crystal superstructure it created.>

No kidding. Kaia moved cautiously through the swirling, shimmering dust, her boots sinking into the soft, sand-like accumulation. It was like walking through a dream, or a nightmare, the familiar shapes of the comms hub all softened, distorted, buried under this strange, beautiful, and potentially lethal snowfall.

She reached the spot where she estimated the breach had been. The wall was still there, but the jagged hole she’d blasted… it was smaller. Much smaller. The white-gold dust, it seemed, wasn’t just settling; it was… accreting. Filling the gaps. Not with the aggressive, hungry growth of the crimson crystal, but with a slow, passive, almost geological process of accumulation.

"Mileo… the breach is closing," Kaia reported, a new knot of dread tightening in her chest. "This dust… it’s filling it in. It’s like being buried alive in slow motion."

<The neutralized Cascade energy within the dust particles may still possess some… residual cohesive properties, Kaia,> Mileo theorized. <Or it could simply be the sheer volume of particulate matter settling into the void. Either way… your window of opportunity for that exit is rapidly diminishing.>

Kaia stared at the shrinking opening. It was now barely large enough for a single person to crawl through, and shrinking with every passing minute. She could make it. But Felix? In his condition? Impossible.

She turned back, looking towards the hazy outline of the server rack where Felix lay. They were trapped. Trapped in a dying crystal tomb that was slowly, gently, trying to absorb them back into its glittering, silent dust.


Part 4: Kaia – Between Dust and Stars

The sight of the rapidly shrinking breach sent a fresh wave of cold despair through Kaia, more chilling than the physical pain from her arm or the psychic echoes of the Crimson Heart. That hole had been their only tangible link to the outside world, a symbol, however fragile, of escape. Now, it was being slowly, inexorably erased by the shimmering, white-gold dust that filled the air like a silent, beautiful blizzard.

She turned back to Felix, a grim resolve hardening her expression. He was drifting again, his breathing shallow beneath the filter mask. The dust was accumulating on him too, a fine, glittering shroud. If they stayed here, they wouldn’t just be crushed by a collapsing ceiling; they’d be slowly, gently entombed.

"Mileo," Kaia’s voice was low, tight with a controlled urgency. "That breach is a no-go for Felix. Even if I could clear it, I can't get him through it in his condition before it seals completely. Are there any other access points to this core chamber on the schematics? Maintenance shafts? Conduits? Anything?"

There was a pause, filled only by the faint creak and groan of the dying crystal structure around them and the soft hiss of Kaia’s own respirator. <Kaia, the original schematics for Comms Hub 7B are… largely irrelevant now,> Mileo’s voice was tinged with a digital sigh. <The Crimson Heart’s growth effectively redesigned the interior. It sealed most of the original access points, or converted them into its own crystalline arteries. The breach you created was likely the only direct route that bypassed its primary defenses. Any other potential exits would be… uncharted, deeply buried, and almost certainly structurally compromised by the core’s collapse. Navigating them, even if we could locate them, would be exceptionally hazardous.>

Exceptionally hazardous. That was Mileo’s polite way of saying ‘suicidal.’

Kaia looked around the vast, dust-filled chamber. The ambient white-gold glow was fading further, the shadows deepening. The silence, once a relief after the Crimson Heart’s oppressive psychic roar, now felt heavy, expectant, like the quiet in a tomb.

She knelt beside Felix again, checking his pulse. Still thready. Too thready. The crystal shard in his thigh, though inert, was a ticking clock. Without proper medical attention, without getting that thing out and stopping the internal bleeding she was sure was happening, he wouldn’t last hours. He might not even last one.

"The rescue team," Kaia said, her voice flat. "What’s their absolute, best-case ETA, Mileo? No sugar-coating."

<Factoring in their mobilization, the current instability of Sector Beta’s transit infrastructure, and the need for heavy cutting equipment to bypass crystal blockages… three hours, Kaia. That is the most optimistic projection. It could be significantly longer if they encounter heavy resistance from remaining transformed elements or further structural collapses.>

Three hours. An eternity. Felix didn't have three hours. And judging by the increasing frequency of the groaning sounds around them, and the way the dust seemed to swirl with a new, subtle vortex near the crater where the Heart had been, this chamber might not have three hours either.

A horrifying thought occurred to her. "Mileo… this dust… you said it was neutralized Cascade energy, possibly with cohesive properties. Is it… is it just going to fill this entire chamber? Are we going to suffocate in it?"

<The particulate density is increasing, Kaia,> Mileo confirmed, his voice devoid of emotion, simply stating a fact. <Your suit’s primary filters will become clogged. The emergency oxygen supply is limited. Felix’s makeshift mask is even less effective. If the current rate of particulate accumulation continues, breathable air will become… a critical issue within approximately ninety minutes.>

Ninety minutes to suffocation. Three hours to rescue. The math was brutal.

Kaia closed her eyes for a moment, a single, hot tear escaping and tracing a path through the dust on her cheek. She was a soldier. A commander. She was supposed to find a way. There was always a way. But here, trapped between a dying crystal god’s remains and the slow, silent creep of a beautiful, lethal dust, the options were dwindling to zero with terrifying speed.

She could try to find another way out. Risk the collapsing, uncharted tunnels, dragging Felix, hoping for a miracle. Or she could stay here, with him, make him as comfortable as possible, and wait for a rescue that would almost certainly arrive too late.

Her gaze fell on the pulse carbine lying beside Felix. Then, on his resonator pistol, still clutched in his limp hand. Weapons. Useless now. The enemy wasn't a monster she could shoot, or a crystal she could shatter. It was physics. Time. Dust.

"Kora," Kaia said, her voice a raw whisper. "Mileo, can Kora hear me?"

<I am here, Kaia,> Kora’s thought-stream, faint but clear, touched her mind. It was like a fragile thread of warmth in the encroaching cold. <We hear you. We… we felt what you did. What we did. It was… incredible.>

"Yeah," Kaia said, a ghost of a smile touching her lips. "Incredible. Listen, Kora… Felix isn’t good. And this place… it’s coming down. Slowly. Quietly. But it’s coming down." She took a ragged breath. "If the rescue team doesn’t make it… if we don’t make it…"

<Don’t say that, Kaia!> Kora’s distress was palpable. <We’re guiding them! Mileo is finding the clearest paths! They’ll get there!>

"Hope for the best, prepare for the worst, right?" Kaia murmured, echoing an old Fractured motto. "Kora… if the worst happens… tell my parents… tell them I didn’t die scared. And tell Sierra… tell her she was right. About everything." Her voice broke slightly. "And you, Kora… your song… it was the most beautiful, terrifying thing I’ve ever heard. Don’t ever stop singing, okay? Don’t let the silence win."

<Kaia, please…> Kora was openly weeping now, her psionic voice a raw ache in Kaia’s mind.

Kaia looked at Felix. His face, even in unconsciousness, even beneath the dust and blood, was peaceful. He trusted her. He’d followed her into hell, and he trusted her to get him out. Or at least, to stay with him until the end.

And that, Kaia realized, was her last choice. Not about escape. Not about fighting. But about how she would face this quiet, glittering end. Alone, trying for a futile escape? Or here, with her brother-in-arms, a steadfast presence in the encroaching dark.

It wasn't really a choice at all.

She reached out with her good hand, gently taking Felix’s hand, the one not holding the resonator pistol. His fingers were cold, but they reflexively tightened around hers for a moment, a ghost of a grip.

"Mileo," Kaia said, her voice surprisingly calm now, a strange peace settling over her. "Keep guiding that rescue team. Give them our exact position. Tell them to watch out for the unstable floor near the central crater. And… tell them to hurry."

She settled back against the server rack, next to Felix, her good hand still holding his. The white-gold dust swirled around them, shimmering in the fading light, slowly, gently, beginning to cover them. The groaning of the dying crystal structure was a mournful lullaby.

"It’s okay, Felix," she whispered, more to herself than to him. "It’s okay. We’re not alone."

Above them, unseen, unknown, the universe held its breath, and the silent, shattered chorus of the Crimson Heart slowly, inexorably, turned to dust and stars.
